I just read this quick [blog](https://canro91.github.io/2025/09/09/RushingToCode/) where the author shares his tips to avoid missing the mark when working on a ticket.

It got me thinking... Rather than putting the responsibility on the developer's shoulders (you have to ask, you have to plan), shoudln't the management have clarify the ticket? Or at least start a conversation to clarify the goals, focus and outline a solution with the developer?

I mean, if the lead cares about how something should be delivered, they should add checkpoints to validate the steps. A small presentation of the how-to is enough to validate or not.

Afterall, it's the lead's job to guide their team toward the right solution, especially if they are invested in the outcome.
